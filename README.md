# ❓ Why's of the project:
### 🤔 I think it is grate of understanding the basic level of a fully funcitional app. How a UI connects with the server, then the DB an viceversa.
### 🚀 It is great to develop programming skills and go deeper in the back-end. Not only to play with ReactJS. I think front-end is beautiful but a simple MERN application like this is a YES overall to practicing.
