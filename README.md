# ❓ Why's of the project:
### 🤔 I think it is grate of understanding the basic level of a fully funcitional app. How a UI connects with the server, then the DB an viceversa.
### 🚀 It is great to develop programming skills and go deeper in the back-end. Not only to play with ReactJS. I think front-end is beautiful but a simple MERN application like this is a YES overall to practicing.

# 👓 Explaining the project:
### In one side > Client: this folder contains all the UI logic.
### In the other > Server in which exists the data-model and the server.
### And outside of the project: the Mongo Data Base.
### ❗ Dont be afraid to clone this repository and install dependencies to try yourself. Just to say, you will have to connect with your own MongoDB credentials 🔐 in the server.js file. 🗄️ Both in server and client folders:
### console > npm/yarn install
