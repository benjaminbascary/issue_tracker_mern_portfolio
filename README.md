# ❓ Why's of the project:
### 🤔 The main reason was to make a tool that the community can use, I think that this app can be useful inside work IT organizations. It is a tool that can help other developers and teams to manage the bugs that they have to solve every day.
### Even I used this when i was developing it!
### 🚀 It is great to develop programming skills and go deeper in the back-end. Not only to play with ReactJS. I think front-end is beautiful but a simple MERN application like this is a YES overall to practicing.

# 👓 Explaining the project:
### In one side > Client: this folder contains all the UI logic.
### In the other > Server in which exists the data-model and the server.
### And outside of the project: the Mongo Data Base.
### ❗ Dont be afraid to clone this repository and install dependencies to try yourself. Just to say, you will have to connect with your own MongoDB credentials 🔐 in the server.js file. 🗄️ Both in server and client folders:
### console > npm/yarn install

# 📘 What did I learn from this?
### I learned a lot, mainly about React and in the end I had a better view of what is server-side-rendering. And that is something that not every front-end developer tends to aknowledge

# 📝 Design:
### Here is a diagram for a better understanding of how I drew this project before coding it.

# 📚 Technology.
### ReactJS, express, mongodb and node. For integration tests I used Cypress.

# 🧠 Problems:
### I could not figure out a way to host this two-folder project in like Heroku or Netlify. If you know or can help pe, please share your toughs and send me an e-mail > benjaminbascary@gmail.com !

# 🧰 Other tools I used aside from the main tech:
### 1 - Bootstrap
### 2 - Environment Variables
### 3 - React-Router
